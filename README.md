# BioMixer
This project is a co-work prototyping making. For an experimental machine designed for empirical learning about bio combinations about materials
The current repository is the interface Code. Includes the user face, what is mainly HTML code, the server code, basicaly python libraries adapted to connect HTML with the microprocesors. Also here is the code for arduino microprocesors

# Flask
This python library was chosen because it is Raspberry basic files, so make it is easier to work with Raspberry ecosystem, and also beacuse python is a quickly edit tool. 
Here are the tools for raise the server. 
The HTML code is located  in the default Flask names.

# pySerial
The current library is used to help in the comunication process between Arduino and Raspberry over usb port.

# Bootstrap
HTML is working with bootstrap environment, so style is basically CSS, main dinamics and comunications are hybrids between python (through flask library) and JS.

# Raspberry
As raspberry is a versatily tool, make easy to link end user application with low level machine work.
Were used it's base OS, raspian. Also  we allow ssh comunication protocol to make it easy transfer files from desktop to raspberry.
Also beacuse its size it makes an adecuate candidate for prototyping instead a regular Computer.

# Arduino
Here are the main controllers for the machine, so the are in direct interaction with the base hardware. So the code is also here.
